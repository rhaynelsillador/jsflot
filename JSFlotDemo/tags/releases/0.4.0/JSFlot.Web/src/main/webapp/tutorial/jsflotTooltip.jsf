	Welcome to the JSFlot tutorial. JSFlot consists of two main JSF tags, the resources tag and the flotChart tag. The resources
	tag is responsible for placing all the required JavaScript code in the rendered HTML page output, and must be included in each
	page that are going to show JSFlot charts. Using templating technologies such as Facelets or Tiles makes this operation a 
	one-time operation for each unique template within your application. 
	<br />
	<br />The flotChart tag is responsible for rendering the HTML output that is required for the browser to show the interactive charts. 
	This tag includes a wide array of attributes that lets you configure and control how the JSFlot looks and behaves. Main features of
