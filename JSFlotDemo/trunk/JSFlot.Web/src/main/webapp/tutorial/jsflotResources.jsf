	The resources tag is responsible for including all the required javascript files. Therefore it is neccessary to 
	include the <b>&lt;jsflot:resources /&gt;</b> tag inside the HEAD portion of the HTML page. If you are using Facelets or 
	another templating library (like Tiles) it makes it easy to include this tag on all pages. When JSFlot is updated 
	to support JSF 2.0, this tag will become obsolete<br />
	<br />
	<b>Advanced Features</b><br />
	There are a number of Javascript files that are included with JSFlot. If you for any reason do not want to inlude one 
	or more of these files they can be excluded from the render. This might be useful if you are using JSFlot with other 
	JSF libraries that already include a minimum version of the same JavaScript files (JBoss RichFaces uses the same prototype
	library as JSFlot for instance). <br />
	<br />
	To exclude a Javascript file, use the excludes attribute. The following will, for instance, exclude the prototype libary
	from being included by JSFlot:  <b>&lt;jsflot:resources excludes="prototype" /&gt;</b>. The excludes attribute takes a comma-separated
	list of libraries to exclude. Possible values are:<br />
	- prototype<br />
	- base64<br />
	- excanvas<br />
	- canvas2image<br />
	- canvastext<br />
	- flotr<br />
	Please be aware though, that excluding any of the required libraries might make JSFlot stop working as intended, or at all. <br />
	<br />
	An additional library, blackbird, can be included if you would like to debug JSFlot. Blackbird is included by specifying the attribute <b>debug="true"</b>.
